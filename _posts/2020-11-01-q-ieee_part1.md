# Quantum-Computing Primer: States, Circuits & Measurement  

## Quantum-Computing Primer: States, Circuits & Measurement  
*Slide set presented to the Q-Hub Research Group at NCSU*

This composite slide lays the foundation:

* **State ket:** a $2^{N}$-component column vector that captures the full, possibly entangled, wave-function of an $N$-qubit register.  
* **Circuit rules:** each gate is a $2^{N}\!\times\!2^{N}$ unitary; chaining gates → matrix multiplication, applying them → matrix × vector.  
* **Measurement matrix:** enumerates every computational-basis branch, clarifying how classical read-out projects the state.  

The Operator function slide shows how quickly the numbers and structures behind quantum computing become incomprehensible to students.

## Puzzle Games ≈ Quantum Intuition  
*Why counter-intuitive game rules make perfect teaching tools*

Games like **Portal**, **Tetris** and **Monument Valley** embrace rules that feel arbitrary or paradoxical—exactly the mindset needed to accept superposition and non-classical operators.  Framing quantum mechanics as a puzzle unlocks curiosity before the “physics baggage” sets in.

## Quantum Hackathon Journey  
*From initial pitch to an award-winning prototype*

* **Initial Pitch:** untangle a scrambled state (tower-defense idea dropped).  
* **Operator-effect visualisation:** show gate action directly on the same qubit axis—even if that meant ditching the fancy exponential-growth animation for v1.  
* **Key lessons learned:** expose the $2^{N}$-way branching, show that *every* operator touches every basis state, and trace a single input through its splits.

## Interactive Gate-Play Demo

A short clip of the prototype running: drag-and-drop gates, immediate visual feedback, and a neural-network-style entanglement diagram updating in real time.
