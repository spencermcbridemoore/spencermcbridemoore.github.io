# Hometown & Early Life

<!--- ![Photo of Durham skyline](../assets/img/about/durham.jpg) -->

I was born and raised in **Durham, North Carolina**—though I've had the good fortune to travel widely and even live overseas. In **Research Triangle** home, splitting most of my adult life between Durham early on and then Raleigh getting my bachelor's and master's in physics at NC State University. It was at this time that I was able to go from numerical physics to studying quantum information placing in multiple hackathons even optimizing specific algorithms for "practice problems" in quantum computing.

After taking a job at Coldquanta I spent a few years in Boulder Colorado before applying PhD programs and taking an offer at University of Central Florida where [I am currently working under Dr. Zhongzhou Chen!](https://sciences.ucf.edu/physics/person/zhongzhou-chen/)(also [here is a link to his personal website/blog](https://zhongzhou.github.io/the-learning-plumber/)). 

Our current work is studying Large Language Models and the dramatic changes they are already bringing to every aspect of how we teach Physics. The incredible pleasant surprise I have had is that between work in quantum computing and numerical methods I had most of the computer science building blocks to dive into the programming and math of Large Language models. Hoping to have more blog posts here about how that goes! I expect to soon have a tab on here outlining online resources to dig into the subject...

# Education

<!--- ![NCSSM campus](/assets/img/about/ncssm.jpg) -->

* **North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics**  Residential, merit‑based public high school specializing in STEM. Diploma from this place is "Baptism by Fire" but your fellow NCSSM-ers are your comrades in arms, and your brain is forever on ludicrous speed!
* **North Carolina State University**

  * B.S. Physics, 2017
  * M.S. Physics, 2019

I include here a slide from a presentation that sums up my history as a researcher:
