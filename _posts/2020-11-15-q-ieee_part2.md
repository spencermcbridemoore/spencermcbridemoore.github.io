## What About the Magenta Lines?  
*Decoding entanglement pathways*

![Magenta entanglement paths](..\assets\img\posts\2020-11-01-q-ieee-22.gif)

Magenta links indicate entangled basis-pairs created by multi-qubit gates.  Cyan highlights show active swap-paths.  Together they give an at-a-glance map of how information is spreading across the register.

## Whole-Circuit Animation  

![Full-circuit fly-through](..\assets\img\posts\2020-11-01-q-ieee-25_45.gif)

Scroll-through of the entire four-qubit circuit, illustrating how every magenta/cyan segment updates as gates propagate.

## Step-by-Step State Evolution  

![State-vector snapshots](..\assets\img\posts\2020-11-01-q-ieee-54.gif)

Green arrows connect each gate to its resulting state-vector; coloured numerators/denominators track amplitude sign & phase so students can verify the math by eye.
