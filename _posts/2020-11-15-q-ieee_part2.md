# Quantum-Computing Primer: States, Circuits & Measurement  

## Quantum-Computing Primer: States, Circuits & Measurement  
*Slide set presented to the Q-Hub Research Group at NCSU*

![State, Circuit & Measurement Overview](..\assets\img\posts\2020-11-01-q-ieee-01_04.png)

This composite slide lays the foundation:

* **State ket:** a $2^{N}$-component column vector that captures the full, possibly entangled, wave-function of an $N$-qubit register.  
* **Circuit rules:** each gate is a $2^{N}\!\times\!2^{N}$ unitary; chaining gates → matrix multiplication, applying them → matrix × vector.  
* **Measurement matrix:** enumerates every computational-basis branch, clarifying how classical read-out projects the state.  

The Operator function slide shows how quickly the numbers and structures behind quantum computing become incomprehensible to students.

## Puzzle Games ≈ Quantum Intuition  
*Why counter-intuitive game rules make perfect teaching tools*

Games like **Portal**, **Tetris** and **Monument Valley** embrace rules that feel arbitrary or paradoxical—exactly the mindset needed to accept superposition and non-classical operators.  Framing quantum mechanics as a puzzle unlocks curiosity before the “physics baggage” sets in.

## Quantum Hackathon Journey  
*From initial pitch to an award-winning prototype*

![Hackathon evolution slides](..\assets\img\posts\2020-11-01-q-ieee-11_14.png)

* **Initial Pitch:** untangle a scrambled state (tower-defense idea dropped).  
* **Operator-effect visualisation:** show gate action directly on the same qubit axis—even if that meant ditching the fancy exponential-growth animation for v1.  
* **Key lessons learned:** expose the $2^{N}$-way branching, show that *every* operator touches every basis state, and trace a single input through its splits.

## Interactive Gate-Play Demo  

![Prototype gate demo](..\assets\img\posts\2020-11-01-q-ieee-13.gif)

A short clip of the prototype running: drag-and-drop gates, immediate visual feedback, and a neural-network-style entanglement diagram updating in real time.

## Showing the Exponential Growth of States

Here in this clip you can see the change in design. What makes it unique is that you can visually observe what makes quantum computing such a astounding change in paradigm.

## What About the Magenta Lines?  
*Decoding entanglement pathways*

![Magenta entanglement paths](..\assets\img\posts\2020-11-01-q-ieee-22.gif)

Magenta links indicate entangled basis-pairs created by multi-qubit gates.  Cyan highlights show active swap-paths.  Together they give an at-a-glance map of how information is spreading across the register.

## Whole-Circuit Animation  

![Full-circuit fly-through](..\assets\img\posts\2020-11-01-q-ieee-25_45.gif)

Scroll-through of the entire four-qubit circuit, illustrating how every magenta/cyan segment updates as gates propagate.

## Step-by-Step State Evolution  

![State-vector snapshots](..\assets\img\posts\2020-11-01-q-ieee-54.gif)

Green arrows connect each gate to its resulting state-vector; coloured numerators/denominators track amplitude sign & phase so students can verify the math by eye.
